# MODLINK & CoinPurse
## Governance Enforcement & Custody Infrastructure

MODX includes two critical governance subsystems: MODLINK and CoinPurse.

These components transform governance from policy into enforceable infrastructure.

## MODLINK — Governance-Enforced Execution Routing

MODLINK is the governing router that connects governance decisions to real execution.

MODLINK:
- Enforces POA rules at execution time
- Routes actions only when valid authority is present
- Connects DAO governance outcomes to system execution
- Produces immutable telemetry and audit records

MODLINK functions as both:
- A governance enforcement mechanism, and
- A proof layer demonstrating compliance in real time

## CoinPurse — Governance Custody & Trustee Access

CoinPurse is the governance custody and access layer of MODX.

CoinPurse:
- Provides trustee-controlled access to sensitive materials
- Manages activation of digital keys under governance rules
- Separates governance authority from consumer financial activity
- Serves as the access gateway for trustees and regulators

CoinPurse is governance infrastructure, not a consumer wallet.

Together, MODLINK and CoinPurse ensure that governance is enforceable, auditable, and institutionally sound.
