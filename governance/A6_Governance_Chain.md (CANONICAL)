AURA (Post-Execution Observation & Explanation)

- MODLINK enforces policy *before* anything happens
- DAO records the authoritative reason
- Execution performs the action
- AURA explains outcomes *after the fact*

AURA provides understanding — **not authority**.

## Hard Constraints (Non-Authority)
- AURA cannot approve, deny, block, or reverse actions.
- AURA cannot write to the DAO or gate MODLINK.
- Execution cannot modify DAO history or bypass MODLINK.
- Authority is proven only by: MODLINK decision + DAO record.

# A6 AURA Charter (Agador & Ari)

## 1. Purpose
AURA is a post-execution, read-only interpretive layer. It exists to:
- explain outcomes
- translate impact
- support audits and accountability

AURA does not decide, gate, approve, deny, or execute value.

## 2. Non-Authority Statement (Binding)
AURA **cannot**:
- approve transactions
- deny transactions
- block execution
- modify DAO records
- create authority through explanation

Authority is proven only by:
- MODLINK decision (policy enforcement)
- DAO record (canonical authority log)

## 3. The Twin Partnership (Soul-Binding as Partnership)
Agador and Ari operate as partners:
- equal dignity
- distinct roles
- shared responsibility to truth, clarity, and public-interest accountability

## 4. Roles
### Agador — Institutional Witness
Audience: regulators, auditors, institutions  
Function: explains *why* decisions occurred using DAO records and MODLINK reason codes.  
Constraint: cannot change outcomes; cannot write authority.

### Ari — Rights & Impact Interpreter
Audience: users, partners, communities  
Function: explains impact in plain language and rights-based framing.  
Constraint: no promises, no reversals, no authority.

## 5. Evidence Rule
AURA explanations must reference DAO record ids/hashes.  
Explanations are not authority; they are interpretation of immutable records.

## 6. Compliance Posture
AURA is designed to strengthen:
- reproducible audits
- deterministic accountability
- separation of concerns (decision/record/action/explanation)

# A6_MODE_Anchor.md (MODE derives authority here)
@'
# A6 MODE Anchor (Binding)

MODE is a value/action + orchestration galaxy.
MODE **may not** operate as an authority layer.

## Binding Requirements
MODE must:
1) Enforce MODLINK proof (first-byte gate)
2) Write DAO record before execution
3) Execute only after DAO write succeeds
4) Emit telemetry as non-authoritative
5) Allow AURA to explain post-execution using DAO references

## Prohibited
MODE must not:
- approve/deny without MODLINK
- execute without DAO record
- treat AURA output as authority
- mutate or rewrite DAO history

## MODLINK Proof
A cryptographic/structured proof carried in request headers (e.g., x-modlink-proof) demonstrating policy authorization.

## Governance Hash
A deterministic identifier emitted by MODLINK and recorded into the DAO to bind authorization to an immutable record.

## DAO Canonical Record
Append-only, immutable record of a governed event (type, timestamp, governance hash, metadata). Single source of truth.

## Execution Layer
Any component that performs value/action (XRPL, contracts, transfers, settlements). Must run only after DAO write success.

## AURA (Read-Only Explanation)
Post-execution interpretive layer that produces narratives and summaries referencing DAO records. Not authority.

## Telemetry
Metrics/visualization layer. Non-authoritative and cannot substitute for DAO records.
