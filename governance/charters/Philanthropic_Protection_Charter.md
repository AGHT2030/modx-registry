# Philanthropic Protection Charter

This Charter ensures that philanthropic participation within MODX is protected from crowd-out, dominance, or speculative pressure.

## 1. Separation of Capital Types

Philanthropic contributions:
- Are distinct from investment allocations
- Are not subordinated to capital return objectives
- Cannot be displaced by larger investors

## 2. Reserved Participation

Certain opportunities may:
- Reserve portions exclusively for philanthropic support
- Prioritize community-aligned funding
- Require grant participation before investment eligibility

## 3. No Extractive Rights

Philanthropic participants:
- Do not receive preferential allocation rights
- Do not gain control or governance leverage
- Do not create long-term hooks into projects

## 4. Reporting & Transparency

Projects receiving philanthropic support must:
- Provide outcome-based reporting
- Disclose use of funds
- Honor declared impact objectives

## 5. Protection Mandate

Philanthropy within MODX exists to enable projects — not to extract value.
