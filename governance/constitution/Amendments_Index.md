# MODX Amendments Index (Public)

This index provides public references to MODX constitutional amendments and related governance updates.

## Authoritative Amendment Enforcement

Amendments are enforced within the backend trust layer (code).  
Public summaries may be published here for transparency.

- Primary constitution enforcement: `backend/trust/trust_Constitution.js`
- Amendment enforcement: *(implemented in the backend trust amendment layer as maintained by MODX)*

> If a public summary differs from enforceable implementation, the backend trust implementation governs.
