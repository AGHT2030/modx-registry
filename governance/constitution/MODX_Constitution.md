# MODX Constitutional Framework (Public Reference)

This document is a **public, human-readable reference** for the MODX constitutional framework.  
It is **not** an executable constitution and does **not** replace the enforceable trust constitution implemented in code.

## Authoritative Enforcement Layer

The authoritative, enforceable MODX Constitution is implemented within the backend trust layer:

- `backend/trust/trust_Constitution.js`

Amendments are implemented as part of the trust layer and are treated as binding modifications within the enforcement system.

> **In the event of any conflict between public documentation and the enforceable trust implementation, the backend trust implementation governs.**

## Constitutional Commitments (High-Level)

MODX operates under sovereign principles designed to prevent capture and preserve fairness:

- **Equal rules for all participants**
- **No preferential access**
- **No allocation control by introducers or administrators**
- **Anti-dominance protections**
- **Time-bound project participation**
- **Mandatory project maturity and sovereign exit**
