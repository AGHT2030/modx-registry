## Governance Overview (A6 Framework)

MODX, CoinPurse, MODE, and AIRS operate under the **A6 Governance Framework** —
a system designed to guarantee accountability, transparency, and infrastructure justice.

### How Decisions Flow
MODLINK → DAO → Execution → AURA


- **MODLINK** enforces policy *before* anything happens  
- **DAO** records the authoritative reason  
- **Execution** performs the action  
- **AURA** explains outcomes *after the fact*

AURA provides understanding — **not authority**.

---

### Why This Matters

- Every action has a recorded reason  
- Every explanation references immutable records  
- No AI system can unilaterally decide, block, or reverse outcomes  

This separation protects:
- users
- institutions
- regulators
- the platform itself
