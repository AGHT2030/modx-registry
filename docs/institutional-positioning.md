# Institutional Positioning (Series A / Pre-IPO Alignment)

MODX is positioned as financial infrastructure, not an application.

- Governance is trust-anchored, not founder-dependent
- Authority is delegated, not assumed
- Execution is governed, not permissionless
- Compliance is designed-in
- Transparency is continuous

This structure supports institutional onboarding, regulatory engagement, bank diligence, and long-term continuity.
