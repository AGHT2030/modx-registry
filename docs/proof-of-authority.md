# Proof-of-Authority (POA) — Public, Non-Operational Overview

MODX uses a Proof-of-Authority (POA) model rather than permissionless signing or user-controlled private keys.

## Public POA Characteristics
- Authority is issued, not assumed
- Authority is explicitly scoped to defined actions
- Authority is time-limited with enforced expiration
- Authority is revocable or suspendable
- Authority usage is observable and auditable

## What POA Is Not
- Not a user wallet
- Not a bearer permission
- Not a permanent credential
- Not transferable between parties

Operational enforcement details, secrets, and credentials are intentionally excluded.
