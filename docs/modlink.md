# MODLINK — Governance-Enforced Execution Routing

MODLINK is the governing router that turns governance into enforcement.

MODLINK:
- Enforces POA rules at execution time
- Routes actions only when valid authority exists
- Connects DAO governance decisions to execution
- Produces immutable telemetry and audit artifacts

MODLINK functions as both:
- A governance enforcement mechanism
- A real-time compliance proof layer
