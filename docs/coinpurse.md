# CoinPurse — Governance Custody & Trustee Access

CoinPurse is the governance custody and access layer of MODX.

CoinPurse:
- Provides trustee-controlled access to sensitive materials
- Manages activation of digital keys under governance rules
- Separates governance authority from consumer financial activity
- Serves as an access gateway for regulators and trustees

CoinPurse functions as governance infrastructure, not a consumer wallet.
